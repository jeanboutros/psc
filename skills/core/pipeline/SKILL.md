description: "The agent-facing state machine for the PSC validation pipeline. Defines phases, gates, state transitions, agent routing, dispatch envelope format, and skill loading rules. All agents must follow this state machine."
---

# Pipeline State Machine

## Purpose

This skill defines the complete pipeline workflow that all agents must follow. It replaces `docs/pipeline/agents.md` as the agent-facing state machine document — agents read this skill, not the docs file, for workflow rules.

## When to Trigger

- **Always loaded** for all agents as part of the core skill set.
- **Additionally triggered** when an agent needs to determine what phase it's in, what gate to run, or how to route work.

## Phase Definitions

### Phase A — Requirements & Design

**Goal:** Define and validate "What" and "How" before writing code.

**Sub-steps:**

| Step | Name | Description | Who |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| A0 | Task Definition | Produce detailed task specification: acceptance criteria, files, constraints, test strategy, doc plan | All agents collaborate |
| A1 | Parallel Specialist Review | All 6 specialists review the proposal independently | SW Engineer, HW Engineer, Wireless Expert, Security Reviewer, Test Engineer, Docs Writer |
| A2 | Dual-Model Challenge | Two model passes review architecture: primary produces, challenger critiques | Supreme Leader orchestrates |
| A3 | A-GATE | T3 + T-ARCH compliance check | All 6 specialists (T3), SW Engineer (T-ARCH) |

**A-GATE pass criteria:** All 6 specialists issue APPROVED or CONDITIONAL PASS + T-ARCH passes.
**A-GATE fail:** Any REJECTED → loop back to A1 with specific critique (max 3 loops at T3).

### Phase B — Build (PAU Loop)

**Goal:** Implement incrementally with self-validation, enforced by compliance gates.

**Sub-steps:**

| Step | Name | Description | Who |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| B1 | PLAN | Read task, identify files, list acceptance criteria, declare logical units | Code Architect |
| B2 | APPLY (per unit) | Implement one logical unit, run build | Code Architect |
| B2a | B-UNIT-GATE | T1 + T-ARCH compliance check after each unit | Code Architect (T1), SW Engineer (T-ARCH) |
| B3 | VALIDATE | Full build, optional flash | Code Architect |
| B3a | B-FINAL-GATE | T1 + T2 + T-ARCH compliance check after all units | Code Architect (T1), SW Engineer (T2 + T-ARCH) |

**B-UNIT-GATE pass criteria:** All 9 T1 checks pass + T-ARCH passes.
**B-FINAL-GATE pass criteria:** T1 passes + T2 passes + T-ARCH passes.
**Failure routing:** T1 → Code Architect fixes; T2 → Code Architect + Software Engineer input; T-ARCH → Software Engineer.

### Phase C — Multi-Agent Verify

**Goal:** Final check before commit. ALL specialist agents must approve.

**Sub-steps:**

| Step | Name | Description | Who |
|------|------|-------------|-----|
| C0 | T1 Re-run | Mechanical compliance re-check on final codebase | Code Architect |
| C1 | Dual-Model Challenge (Verification) | Primary verifier + challenger verifier | Supreme Leader orchestrates |
| C2 | Parallel Specialist Approval | All 6 specialists review independently | All 6 specialists |
| C3 | C-GATE | T1 re-run + T3 + T-ARCH | Code Architect (T1), Specialists (T3), SW Engineer (T-ARCH) |

**C-GATE pass criteria:** T1 passes + all 6 APPROVED + T-ARCH passes.

## Dispatch Envelope Format

Every agent dispatch carries a structured envelope. This ensures context is preserved across handoffs.

```yaml

trigger: "<reason for this dispatch>"
agent: "<agent-role>"

## Dual-Model Challenge Protocol

Used in **Phase A** (architecture) and **Phase C** (verification).

### How It Works

1. **Primary pass** — First model produces the output (architecture proposal or verification).
2. **Challenger pass** — Second model independently reviews, looking for:
   - Contradictions with datasheet/spec
   - Missed edge cases
   - Unsupported assumptions
   - Security gaps
   - Protocol non-compliance
   - T-ARCH violations (logical errors, structural issues, principle misalignment)
3. **Synthesis** — Supreme Leader merges findings:
   - Agreements → accepted
   - Contradictions → presented to user for decision
   - One-sided findings → accepted if well-evidenced, otherwise flagged

### When to Invoke Dual-Model Challenge

| Scenario | Use Dual-Model? |
|----------|-----------------|
| New register implementation | Yes |
| New protocol feature (whitening, CRC, etc.) | Yes |
| HAL interface change | Yes |
| Architecture change | Yes |
| Bug fix in existing code | No (single pass sufficient) |
| Documentation-only change | No |
| Trivial refactor (rename, move) | No |

## How to Read AGENTS.md and Load Domain Skills

### Tech Stack Reference

Before starting any task, read `AGENTS.md` for:
- **Multi-Agent Validation Pipeline** (Mandatory) — the 3-phase pipeline summary
- **Key Rules** — no-assumption, PAU loop, quality gate, incremental execution, flag protocol, compliance gates
- **Documentation Rules** — doc format requirements for the project
- **Design Principles** — typed vocabulary, module boundaries, structural rules
- **Domain-Specific Traps** — critical known pitfalls for the project's tech stack
- **Knowledge Management Rules** — learning doc creation requirements

### Skill Loading Rules

1. **Always loaded (core skills):** assumption-trap, compliance-gate, pipeline, pau-loop, verification-before-completion, self-audit-checklist, review-confidence, type-design-review, silent-failure
2. **Domain skills (load based on task):** any domain skills listed in AGENTS.md for the project's tech stack; datasheet-verification, memory-safety, systematic-debugging, test-driven-development as needed
3. **Phase skills (load based on phase):** brainstorming (Phase A), incremental-execution (Phase B), grill-me (Phase A or C dual-model challenge)
4. **Compliance expansion (load based on OWASP triggers):** Review task for new concern categories and load additional compliance checks as needed

### Mandatory Skill Loading Order

When a task is dispatched, skills must be loaded in this order:
1. `assumption-trap` — FIRST, always
2. `compliance-gate` — tiered checks, OWASP expansion
3. `pipeline` — this skill, state machine
4. `pau-loop` — for Phase B work
5. Domain-specific skills as needed

## Self-Reflection Clause

After any pipeline violation or gate failure, the responsible agent MUST ask:

1. **Why was this not caught earlier?** — What review, test, or protocol gap allowed it through?
2. **What procedural safeguard would have caught it?** — What specific check, test, or verification step would have prevented it?
3. **Update the knowledge base** — Add the lesson to the relevant skill or learning doc.

Violations in the pipeline process itself (wrong routing, missed gate, skipped step) should be logged as flags and added to the pipeline skill's lessons learned.
